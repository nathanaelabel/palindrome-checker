# Palindrome Checker  

An iOS application built with **UIKit** that allows users to input a word and check whether itâ€™s a palindrome.  

---  

## ðŸ“– About the Project  
This project was developed during a **Live Coding user interview** at one of the top private banking companies in Indonesia. It was my first experience with **live coding**, where I learned a lot by starting a project from scratch under a time constraint to solve the **palindrome input challenge** using **UIKit**.  

---  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
- Create an **interactive iOS application** to check for palindromes.  
- Utilize **UIKit** to build the user interface dynamically.  
- Implement a **real-time palindrome validation** feature.  

---  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **User input field** to enter a word or phrase.  
- **Real-time palindrome validation** with instant feedback.  
- **Simple and intuitive UIKit-based UI design**.  

---  

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- **Platform**: iOS  
- **Programming Language**: Swift  
- **Framework**: UIKit
